## Motor Driver for Robotic arm

This code is responsible for position control for the robotic arm in Kyb, as well as system identification logging for the motors and system as a whole.

### Current state

* The GUI can control the robot arm from a laptop over serial.
* The logging for system identification is working correctly.

### TODO

* Implement a website for position control over wifi.
* Add communication to the force sensor.
* Add current sensors for future collaborative mode.
