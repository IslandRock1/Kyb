## Motor Driver for Robotic arm

This code is responsible for position control for the robotic arm in Kyb, as well as system identification logging for the motors and system as a whole.

### Current state

* The motor driver can successfully get the motor do a desired position.
* The logging for system identification is working correctly.

### TODO

* Implement a website for position control over wifi.
* Add comunication to the force sensor.
